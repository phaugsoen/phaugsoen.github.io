<p>Stay focused. Surround yourself with angels, positive energy, beautiful people, beautiful souls, clean heart, angel. The key is to enjoy life, because they don’t want you to enjoy life. I promise you, they don’t want you to jetski, they don’t want you to smile. Stay focused. You smart, you loyal, you a genius. Life is what you make it, so let’s make it. You do know, you do know that they don’t want you to have lunch. I’m keeping it real with you, so what you going do is have lunch.</p>
